    owl_batch.jobs.php-scripts.README.txt 
        contains guidelines on how jobs are built
        
    Directories for each individual job
     
    If there is a online script to perform a functions duplicated here, 
       the "DOSOMETHING" part of the name is the same as the oniine script name

    In each /job/DOSOMETHING directory, you may have:
        batch-DOSOMETHING.bat - a windows batch file to run the program
        	See notes on multiple .sh scripts below.
        batch-DOSOMETHING.php - a php script to be run in batch mode 
                                Note: scripts written in other languages should follow
                                      the same convention
        batch-DOSOMETHING.log - log file from running the script
        batch-DOSOMETHING.sh  - a *nix shell script to run the program
        	Note: You may want to build multiple shell scripts
        	if your php script has multiple options 
        	based on arguments passed.  In this case, name the scripts
        	batch-DOSOMETHING-DESC1.sh
        	batch-DOSOMETHING-DESC2.sh
        	etc.
