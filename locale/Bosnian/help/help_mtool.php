<h2>E-Mail Tool</h2>
The e-mail tool of Owl Intranet lets you send an e-mail with or without a file to anybody.

<p>To send an e-mail you need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you got to the e-mail tool by choosing &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->sendfile?>&rdquo; you can decide whether to attach the file or just send the weblink to the file.</li>
<li>In the field &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->email_to  ?>&rdquo; fill in the correct e-mail address, e.g. user@domain.com. If you want to send your e-mail to another Owl user let the field &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->email_to  ?>&rdquo; empty and choose this user from the list.</li>
<li>If you want to send a copy of your mail to another person fill in the address into the field &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->email_cc  ?>&rdquo;</li>
<li>Check if your own e-mail address is correctly written in the field &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->email_reply_to  ?>&rdquo;. If this is not the case fill in your correct e-mail address and don't forget to update your address in your <?php echo $owl_lang->preference  ?>. It is very important that your correct e-mail address appears in the &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->email_reply_to  ?>&rdquo; field as this permits the recipient to answer your mail.</li>
<li>Fill in the subject of your mail into the field &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->email_subject  ?>&rdquo;.</li>
<li>In the field &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->email_body  ?>&rdquo; write your e-mail. You can write in any language you like. The e-mail will be displayed correctly.</li>
<li>To send your e-mail push the button &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->btn_send_email  ?>&rdquo;. You will be brought back to the browser. If you want to reset the whole form click on &ldquo;<?php echo $owl_lang->btn_reset  ?>&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
